  or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.
</p>

  conditions unless you cancel it or WEB 3.0 SOFT LIMITED cancels it. You may cancel your&nbsp;
  Subscription
  renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting WEB 3.0 SOFT LIMITED
