                            (CalOPPA)&nbsp;</strong></h3>



                    <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online
                        services&nbsp;
                        to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a
                        person&nbsp; or
                        company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting&nbsp;
                        personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous
                        privacy&nbsp; policy
                        on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with&nbsp;
                        whom it
                        is being shared, and to comply with this policy. – See more at:&nbsp;
